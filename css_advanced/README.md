# CSS Advanced Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Curriculum** and focuses on implementing **advanced CSS styling** based on a design provided in Figma. It builds upon the HTML structure from the **HTML, advanced** project and challenges us to turn a static HTML page into a fully styled, pixel-perfect web page using CSS.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and implement advanced CSS concepts including:
  - Flexbox and Grid layout systems
  - Positioning and z-index
  - Responsive design techniques
  - Custom fonts and text styling
  - Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- Reproduce a professional design layout from Figma
- Write clean, maintainable CSS
- Use semantic HTML5 elements effectively

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to translate a Figma design into a real webpage
- Structuring CSS for scalability and readability
- Integrating custom fonts and assets into a project
- Working with image overlays, banners, and hero sections
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness
